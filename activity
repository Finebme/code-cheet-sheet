Underlying the visual process model above is the XML structure of BPMN.

@Bean
public TaskRuntimeEventListener taskAssignedListener(){
	return task->logger.info(task.getEntity().getName);
}
注册一个监听器，当有runtime event 发生的时候会被触发。

public interface TaskRuntime {
  TaskRuntimeConfiguration configuration();
  Task task(String taskId);
  Page tasks(Pageable pageable);
  Page tasks(Pageable pageable, GetTasksPayload payload);
  Task create(CreateTaskPayload payload);
  Task claim(ClaimTaskPayload payload);
  Task release(ReleaseTaskPayload payload);
  Task complete(CompleteTaskPayload payload);
  Task update(UpdateTaskPayload payload);
  Task delete(DeleteTaskPayload payload);
  ...
}

@Autowired
private TaskRuntime taskRuntime;

taskRuntime.create(
            TaskPayloadBuilder.create()
                .withName("First Team Task")
                .withDescription("This is something really important")
                .withGroup("activitiTeam")
                .withPriority(10)
           .build());

public interface ProcessRuntime {
  ProcessRuntimeConfiguration configuration();
  ProcessDefinition processDefinition(String processDefinitionId);
  Page processDefinitions(Pageable pageable);
  Page processDefinitions(Pageable pageable,
              GetProcessDefinitionsPayload payload);
  ProcessInstance start(StartProcessPayload payload);
  Page processInstances(Pageable pageable);
  Page processInstances(Pageable pageable,
              GetProcessInstancesPayload payload);
  ProcessInstance processInstance(String processInstanceId);
  ProcessInstance suspend(SuspendProcessPayload payload);
  ProcessInstance resume(ResumeProcessPayload payload);
  ProcessInstance delete(DeleteProcessPayload payload);
  void signal(SignalPayload payload);
  ...
}


The RepositoryService is probably the first service needed when working with the Activiti engine. This service offers operations for managing and manipulating deployments and process definitions. Without going into much detail here, a process definition is a Java counterpart of BPMN 2.0 process. It is a representation of the structure and behaviour of each of the steps of a process. A deployment is the unit of packaging within the Activiti engine. A deployment can contain multiple BPMN 2.0 xml files and any other resource. The choice of what is included in one deployment is up to the developer. It can range from a single process BPMN 2.0 xml file to a whole package of processes and relevant resources (for example the deployment hr-processes could contain everything related to hr processes). The RepositoryService allows to deploy such packages. Deploying a deployment means it is uploaded to the engine, where all processes are inspected and parsed before being stored in the database. From that point on, the deployment is known to the system and any process included in the deployment can now be started.
