[[nodiscard]] the return value should not be discard .   since c++ 20.

constexpr 常量表达式关键字，在编译阶段就把变量计算出来当成常量使用，提高运行速度

you can think of the complier as a pipeline where each stage'sjob is to organize the data representing the user's code in a way that makes next stage simpler to implement

logic gates abstract away the details of CMOS
machine language abstracts away the detail of logic gates
assembly language abstracts away the details of machine languages
programming language abstracts away the detail of assembly languages

FPGA Filed Programmable Gate Array is a hardware an array of re-configurable gates that makes circuit structure programmable after it is shipped away from the factory

the difference between FPGA and other embedded computers is that programs in FPGA are implemented at the digital logic level, while programs in embedded computers like microcontrollers or system-on-chip devices are implemented at assembly code level

hexdump asmfile
nasm -f bin asmfile outputfile    generate binary code
objdump -d asmfile               show assembly code

REPL Read a line of input,Evaluate it,Print the result,then Loop and do it all over again.

Near pointer is a 16-bit/32-bit offset within a segment,also called effective address.
Far pointer is also an offset like a near pointer, but with an explicit segment selector.

ELF => Executable and Linkable Format

for sufficiently large n(n>k),xn becomes and stays as close to p as like.
